  "about": [
    "It turns out that atoms behave a lot like superballs, and we can, in fact, model an atom by just changing some of the parameters.",
"Because atoms move so quickly and are so small, the model has been modified so time is slowed down a billion times (otherwise we would just see a blur of motion), and we have to magnify our view by a billion times as well (or the atoms would be too small to see). "
